Technology plays an increasing role in the modern world; computer science provides students with the skills and knowledge to understand the technology they use daily and to extrapolate this knowledge to understand and use emerging technologies.
Computer Science can be seen as comprising four facets:
Computer Hardware
Using Computer Software
Solving Problems by Developing Software
Computers, People, and Society

#<a name="Course_Overview"></a>Course Overview 
This course emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology using the Java programming language.  Specifically, we will be concentrating on problem solving and algorithm development, skills which are very useful in several areas of study.  AP Computer Science A counts as a high school math credit, and is the equivalent of a first-semester college course in Computer Science.  Students will be developing their own computer programs, applications, and games to perform specific tasks.  Students scoring high enough on the end-of-year AP Exam can receive three college credit hours.  AP Computer Science A is especially beneficial for students considering a major in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or other technology areas.

*  Sourcebook– for note-taking and journals
*  folder or 3-ring binder – to file your work safely in
*  pencils
*  Flash Drive (minimum storage: 2 gigabytes)

#<a name="classroom_rules"></a>Classroom Rules
 
Respect is the key.  Focus on yourself and not others.
*  Be on time.  You must report your excused absences to Ms. Lora.
*  Talk respectfully:
  *  No talking during a lesson.
	*  Use respectful language.
	*  Raise your hand, quietly, if you have a question or comment.
  *  Keep noise to a minimum!
*  No food, drink, or gum.  Bottled water is fine.
*  Do not throw things.  If you have trash, walk it to the trashcan.
*  Only leave classroom with permission.  Do NOT ask to leave during a lesson.
*  Use class time responsibly.  Always remain on task with your DO NOW, practice, and HW.
*  Ask about your grade after class is over.  Class time is to be spent on current work.

Grading Scale 
--------------
![alt text](http://activegrade.com/images/getstarted/scale-4point.png "Grading Scale")
#<a name="attendance"></a>Attendance and Punctuality
Attendance and punctuality are required for every class for every student.  If students are absent or late without a valid excuse and do not complete a compensatory make up time, it will lower their grades.

	(3 tardies = 1 unexcused absence)
	4 unexcused absences = lower one grade
	5 unexcused absences = lower two grades
	6 unexcused absences = lower three grades
	7 unexcused absences = automatic failure

This applies to each nine and one half-week advisory.  The same policy applies to being late to class.  Persistent attendance problems can result parental contacts and referrals to a school administrator for disciplinary action.  Students who miss school must be responsible to seek out their teacher to make up lost time to restore their grade.
